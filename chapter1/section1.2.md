### CASE #1
In the process ofdoing an axillary lymph node dissection in a 50 year-old patient suffered frombreast cancer, the surgery resident cleans the space between the pectoralismajor and minor muscles, in an attempt to remove all of the axillary lymphnodes. Unfortunately, the patient lost a lot of blood because of the damage oflarge artery surrounded by the lymph nodes. When repairing the severed arterythe surgeon has to separate the nerves besides the artery. Two weeks later, thepatient has pronounced neurological deficits. There is lack of cutaneoussensation between his thumb and index finger on the dorsal side, diminishedsensation on the dorsal surface of the forearm, arm, and lateral side of theshoulder. He has "wrist drop", lack of extension at the elbow, andalthough abduction can be initiated, it cannot be completed. Flexion,extension, medial and lateral rotation of the arm are not significantlyaffected. There is no "winging of the scapula.”  

1. Which cavity wasopened when the surgeon reflected the pectoralis major and minor muscles?  
2. How do the lymphnodes arrange and drain in this region?  
3. Which largeartery was severed in this case?  
4. How does his bigartery send its branches to supply the structures around?  
5. Which largenerve bundle was severed?  What is thelocation and passage of this large nerve bundle?
